Our Talent Management project allows artists to display their works to an audience seeking to hire artists for events like music, dance, acting, public speaking, painting, etc. Customers can use this platform to choose from a wide range of artists for their events. The project aims to create an application that helps artists expand their audience and makes it easy for 
event organisers to pick the right performer. The Talent management project aims to 
manage artists' information, work and projects and provide customers with an online
