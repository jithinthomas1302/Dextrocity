# Dextrocity
A BCA Final Year Major Project focused on UI/UX Design, Cloud Services and Database Management

# Overview
We aim to boost an artist's potential and provide a digital stage to showcase their skills. Our Talent Management project allows artists to display their works to an audience seeking to hire artists for events like music, dance, acting, public speaking, painting, etc. Customers can use this platform to choose from a wide range of artists for their events. The project aims to create an application that helps artists expand their audience and makes it easy for 
event organisers to pick the right performer. The Talent management project aims to 
manage artists' information, work and projects and provide customers with an online 
booking system. Finding the right artist for an event is now effortless through our digital 
solution. Our website helps customers and artists establish a communication channel for 
potential bookings and performances. This platform not
only simplifies the search for talented artists and helps artists find new clients and 
performance opportunities
